# About Me
I am Asheris Starglade, a Wood Elf hailing from a secluded woodland community near Haling Cove, my families legacy is deeply intertwined with the Sylvan Sentinels, a revered group responsible for safeguarding the forest surrounding [Haling Cove](#haling-cove), the thriving city on the bay. However, despite my family's heritage, I have chosen a different path for myself.
:
Growing up in the woods, I developed a strong affinity for nature and a profound connection with the forest's creatures. As I reached adulthood, a sense of wanderlust and curiosity about the wider world drove me to embark on my own journey rather than following in the footsteps of my family. I sought to deepen my understanding of the diverse cultures and forge their own path as a Twilight Cleric, drawing upon the celestial gift they received in the hidden glade.
:
Despite not joining the ranks of the Sylvan Sentinels, I remain deeply committed to the protection of the forest and the harmony between the city and the natural world. I strive to use my divine powers to heal, guide, and bring balance wherever I go.

## Chapter 1 - Willdale and the Cloakwood
::

### Travels to Willdale
*Play Date: June 20, 2023*
::

#### On the Road
*My entires for today are not complete as this page of the journal got wet in my travels. - Ash*
:
We received a letter from a courier with a request for us to find [Talia](#talia) about a job. Gold these days has been getting short. So we figured the short walk was worth while. Travels to [Willdale](#willdale) are usually uneventful.
::

#### Town Center
**NEET TO FILL ALL THIS INFO IN...... FIND NOTES! luicy and i goign around, booming voice, the rest looking for tavern, etc. lucy robing tavern owner, us fleeing to the edge of town. Lucy taking pants. "Grabs the sack and gives him a wink"**

::::

### Meeting Talia
*Play Date: June 27, 2023*
::
#### Middle of the Night
::
I was awoken in the middle of the night from my resting state. I heard a noise from the darkness ahead but couldn't quite place it. The rest of my adventurers appeared to be sleeping, having rushed from town the evening before. The ash's from the nights fire barely glowing. 
:
Suddenly a sticky web pinned me to a tree, I couldn't move at all. I looked out into the darkness, even with my keen eyesight, I was unable to see what is trapping me, or who attacked us. While [D3PUTY](#d3puty) looks out into the distance I wake up [Kuran](#kuran). Neither of them are able to see the monster either. We awaken the rest of the team.
:
I think in an attempt to bring light to the darkness, [Kuran](#kuran) lights a bolt of cloth on fire. Illuminating the area around us, but the foe remained cloaked in darkness. [Aleric](#aleric-mysticmind-stoneweaver) attempted to scare the monster with his *Hideous Laughter* but was unable to conjure the spell in his sleepy mental fog.
:
I am eventually able to break free from the sticky web after [Lucy](#lucy) ignites the tree I am trapped against on fire. But not before the team is struck with booming thunder from the skies ([Aleric](#aleric-mysticmind-stoneweaver) really needs to wake up!).
:
A giant armored spider finally makes it appearance by pouncing on [Aleric](#aleric-mysticmind-stoneweaver) -- pinning him to the ground! I attempted to attack the beast. Conjuring up my [Guiding Bolt](#guiding-bolt) but am unable to work it. (I really need to practice more).

:
With this failure, [D3PUTY](#d3puty) pulls his longbow (from where, I have no idea), and fires against the best. It collapses, defeated.

#### Meeting Talia
With the morning sun starting to rise I heard footsteps coming from the distance. An Elf and Dwarf approach. The Elf introduced herself as [Talia](#talia). Her and her dwarven comrades bring us to their camp in the north-east of [Willdale](#willdale).
:
The camp is made up of a handful of wooden cabins scattered about a small field -- [The Cloakwood](#the-cloakwood) surrounding it. I did notice a familiar tower near the edge of camp. Though I can't quite place it.
:
[D3PUTY](#d3puty) has discovered what [Talia](#talia) may want us for: he discovered that [Talia](#talia) has been doing some extensive research into the Fey of the [Cloakwood](#the-cloakwood).
:
We met [Talia](#talia) outside. She informed us we have been hired to determine why the [Brownies](#brownies) have been attacking the towns folk and loggers.
:
[D3PUTY](#d3puty) pulled from his knowledge-base that this is very unusual behavior for [Brownies](#brownies), they are typically "insited", simple minded, and there are for scarier things in [The Cloakwood](#the-cloakwood) than dwarves.
: 
[Talia](#talia) has provided us direction, and we set out.
:
### The Cloakwood
*Play Date: July 11, 2023*


#### Discovering the Cloakwood
:
We embarked on a path known to be tread by the Brownies in and through the [Cloakwood](#cloakwood), diminutive creatures standing no taller than four feet. We moved through the forest, guided by the gaps in the trees, where the sunlight streamed through to light our way.
:
My mind drifted back to old stories and knowledge: the Brownies, typically solitary creatures, with no central leadership to speak of. They set up camps in various locations, drawn to the beauty of the world and the promise of ample sustenance. They often steer clear of humanoids, choosing to dwell in peace. Tales speak of Sylvans driven out of their towers - a disturbing anecdote of the times we live in. Their language is a mixture of Sylvan, Halfling, and at times, Common. 
:
[Kuran](#kuran) attempted to get a better view of our surroundings by scaling a towering tree but was unable to spot anything significant.
:
As the forest path narrowed, we made a strategic decision to split up - [D3PUTY](#d3puty) and [Aleric](#aleric-mysticmind-stoneweaver) ventured east, while [Kuran](#kuran) and I headed south. The path underfoot was well-trodden and quiet, the silence only punctuated by the sounds of wildlife in the distance.
:
Eventually, those who headed east found themselves in a clearing, a vast opening in the otherwise dense woodland. I look forward to reuniting with them soon and sharing what we have discovered in our respective journeys.
::
#### The Tent
:
{{note
##### Account of Aleric, D3PUTY, and Kuran
:
The group had found themselves in a serene setting—a small pond adjacent to a towering boulder. Kuran had taken the initiative to explore the area in search of signs of the elusive Brownies, while Aleric and D3PUTY observed with anticipation. The tranquil atmosphere and the air of mystery that surrounded the scene piqued his curiosity.
}}
:
As I stealthily made my way through the eastern forest, I skillfully maneuvered around the worn and disheveled camp in the distance. My goal was clear: reach the trail that led northward to meet up with [Aleric](#aleric-mysticmind-stoneweaver), [Kuran](#kuran), and [D3PUTY](#d3puty). I knew the importance of maintaining a safe distance from the tent, so I focused on staying hidden as I moved through the undergrowth.
:
Every step I took was deliberate, ensuring I made no unnecessary noise that could give away my presence. The forest seemed to offer its guidance, revealing hidden paths that led me closer to my companions. I remained vigilant, scanning my surroundings for any signs of danger or potential obstacles.
:
Navigating through the dense foliage, I followed the concealed trail with determination. I carefully evaded any traces of detection, my instincts guiding me towards the rendezvous point. Finally, I emerged from the forest, relieved to see the familiar faces of [Aleric](#aleric-mysticmind-stoneweaver), [Kuran](#kuran), and [D3PUTY](#d3puty) waiting for me.

:
With a sense of accomplishment, I explained my decision to bypass the worn and disheveled camp, focusing instead on our shared journey and the mysteries that awaited us. 
:
#### Fudh and Goim
:
We headed south towards the tent and [Kuran](#kuran) and I skillfully approached the worn and disheveled tent, our curiosity pushed us to investigate further. [Kuran](#kuran) quietly peeked inside, revealing a surprising scene of Brownies engrossed in sticks and dice games. Among them, two stood out—one with a brown hat and the other with a distinctive red hat.
:

To our astonishment, the Brownie with the red hat noticed Kuran's presence and eagerly divulged details about their camp. He mentioned that their leader, known as [Grum](#grum), was waiting for us. Intrigued, [Aleric](#aleric-mysticmind-stoneweaver) joined our conversation, observing that the Brownie with the red hat seemed a little peculiar, smirking and hinting at the mysterious nature of meeting Grum.
:
They introduce themselves as [Fud](#fud) and [Goim](#goim).
:
However, it was [the Brownie](#the-brownies) wearing the brown hat who seized the opportunity. He cunningly offered to exchange our gold for a chance to meet Grum and be guided to their camp. With a slight hesitation, we relinquished the gold, intrigued by the prospect of discovering more about these enigmatic Brownies and their elusive leader.
:
#### To the Camp
:
As [Aleric](#aleric-mysticmind-stoneweaver) and [Kuran](#kuran) trailed the Brownies towards their camp, [D3PUTY](#d3puty) quietly followed Kuran's lead, while I stealthily sneaked alongside, remaining unnoticed by the rest of the party. Little did we know that [Grum](#grum), the leader of the Brownies, would turn out to be an unusually large and fat Boggle, a rare sight given their usual small stature.
:
Seizing the opportunity, I crept up behind [Grum](#grum) and the Brownies in their camp, equipped with sleeping mushroom spores harvested from the mushrooms growing on my shoulders. With a swift application, I put three of the Brownies to sleep, leaving the remaining ones trembling in fear as they fled. The group, sensing an advantage, launched an attack on Grum.
:
I took the initiative and employed a necrotic mushroom, inflicting severe damage akin to an acid burn onto Grum's shoulder. Our combined efforts proved successful as we fought valiantly, taking on the formidable Boggle. The encounter was intense and full of surprises, as our party faced a foe larger and more dangerous than expected.
::
![boggle-grum](https://github.com/method1020/Ash-Adventures/blob/main/images/people/boggle_grum.jpg?raw=true) {width:100%,mix-blend-mode:multiply}
:
In the midst of the chaotic battle, [Aleric's](#aleric-mysticmind-stoneweaver) attempt to cast hideous laughter on [Grum](#grum) backfires, leaving him laughing uncontrollably. [Kuran's](#kuran) attack misses its mark, and [Grum](#grum), displaying an unexpected ability, becomes shiny and oily, reappearing on the other side of the field. [D3PUTY's](#d3puty) attempt with the longbow also fails, as does my own with the crossbow.
:
Determined to subdue [Grum](#grum), [Kuran](#kuran) fiercely strikes him while he tries to escape. [Grum](#grum), displaying his teleportation ability, surprises us by suddenly appearing behind me. [Aleric](#aleric-mysticmind-stoneweaver), moving with surprising swiftness, pommels Grum with a dagger, rendering him unconscious.
:
As I survey the remaining Brownies, [Kuran](#kuran) shouts, "Are you not amused?" After [Kuran's](#kuran) taunting words echo through the clearing, the remaining Brownies are visibly frightened. The unexpected display of power from our group and the defeat of their leader, Grum, have left them no choice but to scatter in all directions. Their tiny figures disappear into the foliage, escaping into the safety of the forest.
:
As the dust settles, the once lively camp now lies in silence, only the rustling of leaves and the occasional hoot of an owl filling the air. We gather ourselves, ensuring that [Grum](#grum) is securely fastened to [D3PUTY's](#d3puty) back. Despite the intensity of the battle, a sense of relief washes over us. We've achieved our goal, but our journey is far from over.
:
With a collective understanding, we decide to make our way back, carrying Grum with us. The forest slowly envelopes us once more as we walk through the undergrowth, retracing our steps to return to the place where it all began.

#### Night Settles In
:
Settled within the confines of [Grum](#grum)'s dim-lit camp, I'm kept awake by the hum of activity around me. [Lucy](#lucy) saunters in, eliciting laughter and amusement from the group as she recounts her latest adventure - an audacious feat involving selling her pilfered trousers from her days in Willdale. Her knack for light-hearted trouble seems to have an almost magical way of lifting our spirits (well, for most of us at least).
:
Having made the decision to overnight in [Grum](#grum)'s thatched shelter, I can hear [D3PUTY](#d3puty) and [Lucy](#lucy) engaged in earnest conversation just beyond the entrance. Their words - questions of reality and meaning - drift in and out of my hearing.
:
From my place of quiet observation, I watch as [D3PUTY](#d3puty) scrutinises [Grum](#grum) with a hardened gaze. He senses a potent, malevolent magic surrounding [Grum](#grum), a force that carries echoes of the Feywild or perhaps the Shadowfell. The air seems to thicken with intrigue and uncertainty as [Grum](#grum) holds us within his enigmatic grip.
:
[Lucy](#lucy), guided by her instinctual acumen for the arcane, tries to discern the nature of [Grum](#grum)'s divine patron. She appears to determine that [Grum](#grum) is a being displaced from another plane, deepening the shroud of mystery that wraps around this curious Boggle.
:
![campfire](https://github.com/method1020/Ash-Adventures/blob/main/images/chapter_1/out-campfire.jpg?raw=true) {width:100%,mix-blend-mode:multiply}
:
As the hours stretch on, I remain ever-watchful, my senses attuned to the sounds and movements that fill the night. The campfire casts dancing shadows across the faces of my companions, its crackling chorus a soothing lullaby against the backdrop of hushed voices. In my state of restful alertness, I bear witness to the stories spun, the revelations uncovered, and the riddles posed - each deepening the complexity of our enthralling journey.
::
### Returning to Willdale
*Play Date: July 18, 2023*
::
#### Leaving the Brownie Camp
:
We, as a group, had been preparing to depart from the camp when our path crossed with that of a unique creature, a Brownie named [Alarin](#alarin), donned in an eye-catching purple hat. She was returning from her ventures in the forest, her wary eyes telling stories untold.
:
Her fear was tangible in the cool air, an emotion I aimed to assuage temporarily using the soporific spores of my magical shoulder mushrooms, their mystical properties sending her into a deep slumber. In her vulnerable state, [Kuran](#kuran) conducted an intrusive yet necessary search, a necessity that never ceases to unsettle me.
:
Upon awakening, [Alarin](#alarin) was met with the calming demeanor of [Aleric](#aleric-mysticmind-stoneweaver), his soothing words breaking through her initial trepidation. In the midst of this, [Lucy](#lucy), seizing an opportunity with an impish grin, absconded with Alarin's purple hat.
:
[Alarin](#alarin)'s attempts at escaping bore no fruit, her fear driving her actions. She revealed tales of a certain Grum, a creature who ruled over the Brownies through fear. Lucy, relentless in her pursuit of knowledge, pressed Alarin for more information. To underscore our intent, I channeled my Thaumaturgy, amplifying Lucy's voice until it echoed ominously throughout the quiet forest. Alarin relented, marking on our map of the Cloakwood forest where others of her kind could be found.
:
With our newly acquired knowledge, we made the collective decision to return to the lumber camp, hopeful to find Talia. As I sit here under the canopy of twilight, our recent encounters weigh on my mind. The balance of our world remains delicate, yet I am hopeful. Standing united with my companions, I trust that we can guide those burdened by fear towards the dawn's light.

#### Back at the Lumber Camp
:
We returned to the lumber camp in [Willdale](#willdale) and reunited with [Talia](#talia). As we gathered around her cabin, I observed the curious sight of [Grum](#grum), the boggle, perched on [D3PUTY](#d3puty)'s back. The encounter with the boggle had left us with many questions, and we eagerly reported to [Talia](#talia) about the dark faye magic we had encountered surrounding [Grum](#grum).
:
[Talia](#talia) took a keen interest in [Grum](#grum) and inspected him closely. I couldn't help but notice the oozing and deteriorating state of [Grum](#grum)'s arm, a result of the necrotic damage I had inflicted during our intense battle with him. [Talia](#talia)'s initial impulse was to shoot and kill [Grum](#grum), but [D3PUTY](#d3puty) intervened, preventing her from taking drastic action.
:
In an unexpected turn of events, [Grum](#grum) suddenly blinked or teleported away while [Lucy](#lucy) tried to charm him for more information about his origin. [Kuran](#kuran) attempted to shoot him with his bow, but the arrow missed its mark.
:
Despite the chaotic encounter, [Talia](#talia) expressed her gratitude, rewarding us for successfully stopping [Grum](#grum). She seemed pleased that we had managed to do so without harming the Brownies in the process.
:
[Talia](#talia) now seeks to introduce us to her master, [Sæsephyr](#sæsephyr). Intrigued by the opportunity, we follow [Talia](#talia) as she leads us to a point on the coast, where a small cabin and pier await. The mysteries of this journey continue to unfold, and I am eager to see what awaits us in the presence of [Sæsephyr](#sæsephyr) and the adventures that lie ahead.
:
#### Sæsephyr
:
Our journey led us to the pier, where [Talia](#talia) guided us to meet [Sæsephyr](#sæsephyr). As we approached, a heavy air filled the surroundings, as if foretelling an impending storm.
:
Then, from the depths of the water, a mesmerizing sight appeared—a scaly and shimmery figure materialized, revealing an enormous dragon—an ancient mist dragon. Its presence was awe-inspiring, and although I had heard stories of such beings in these lands, I had never laid eyes on one before.
:
![sas](https://github.com/method1020/Ash-Adventures/blob/main/images/people/saesephyr.jpg?raw=true) {width:100%,mix-blend-mode:multiply}
:
The dragon, whom [Talia](#talia) addressed as [Sæsephyr](#sæsephyr), seemed to have some familiarity with me, though I couldn't quite place it. Tales of an ancient mist dragon named [Sæsephyr](#sæsephyr) had circulated, and I now found myself standing before this enigmatic creature.
:
Aleric's unease was evident, and Kuran shared the same sentiments. Their caution was well-founded in the presence of such an imposing being.
:
[Sæsephyr](#sæsephyr) spoke with wisdom and urgency, revealing a long-forgotten tale of two wizards seeking ancient magical artifacts near the town of Haling Cove. The fate of these artifacts and the surrounding realms rested on their decisions. The demise of the wizards—Archmage Roberto and the ambitious Belven—remained shrouded in mystery, with the ominous presence of The Sæsha'sol (The Sea Gloom) casting shadows over their fate.
:
The dragon entrusted us with a crucial task—to journey to Haling Cove and uncover the lost artifacts. A daunting responsibility, one that [Sæsephyr](#sæsephyr) himself refrained from taking due to the attention it might draw.
:
As a sign of his trust, [Sæsephyr](#sæsephyr) offered us magical tools from the cabin by the pier, essential for our upcoming quest.

{{note
##### Sæsephyr
“Travelers, I have asked Talia to seek you out, because I believe you have the best chance to succeed. Long ago, two wizards sought out ancient magical artifacts, near the town of Haling Cove. Archmage Roberto believed he could unravel their secrets and took with him a delegation to take the artifacts somewhere they could be kept safe and studied, whereas the younger, more ambitious Wizard Belven wanted to study them for himself, and knew as soon as they were in Roberto’s vaults they’d be out of his reach.
:
“As Roberto prepared to take an artifact from the oceans, he was found murdered on the docks. Some suspected Belven, but the town of Haling Cove sided with Belven - they found him charming, and he planned to retrieve the tablet for himself.
:
A few months later, Belven was also found dead, his back full of tiny spears - likely the work of the The Sæsha'sol (The Sea Gloom). It’s uncertain whether he found and retrieved any of the artifacts or not.
:
Go to Haling Cove and find the artifacts. The fate of the Cloakwood, the Sea of Swords, and perhaps even Faerun itself hangs in the balance. I would do this task myself, but fear I would draw far too much attention to things that are best left quiet.
:
The presence of your Boggle suggests that the situation is worsening, and we can no longer simply watch.
:
-Sæsephyr
}}

Our meeting with [Sæsephyr](#Sæsephyr) bore important counsel - the Sea of Swords is treacherous and best avoided, we were advised to stick to land routes. Retrieving the artifacts ourselves was deemed the prudent choice, for if [Sæsephyr](#Sæsephyr) were to attempt, it might draw an undesirable amount of attention. However, [Sæsephyr](#Sæsephyr)'s promise of assistance should we need and call for it was reassuring.
:
Even as we discussed our plans, [Lucy](#lucy) showed her carefree spirit, leaping into the water from the pier, swimming lazily, revelling in the moment. Meanwhile, [Aleric](#aleric-mysticmind-stoneweaver) sought to understand the relationship between Talia and [Sæsephyr](#Sæsephyr), learning that Talia served as [Sæsephyr](#Sæsephyr)'s emissary in dealing with others.
:
The mention of Haling Cove stirred my memory - a story from my childhood about two wizards, Belvin and Roberto. As a child, I had lived through their time, their tales now a part of history and lore.
:
Our journey brought us past a fascinating fountain near the pier as we made our way to the cabin for supplies. [D3PUTY](#d3puty) examined the fountain, noticing runes inscribed along its side. Despite [Aleric](#aleric-mysticmind-stoneweaver)'s assistance, the nature of the runes eluded us, though we recognized the fountain as a potential source of mana.
:
In a playful jest, [Lucy](#lucy) dared us to drink the water, and before [Aleric](#aleric-mysticmind-stoneweaver) could even respond, Talia scooped up a handful of the fountain's water and drank, a demonstration of faith in the unknown.

#### Small Vial of Mana
*Potion*
:
These small vials of mana provide many benefits: Drink before a spell to add 2 to the consumers spell casting modifier or roll a D20, if 11 or greater, restore a spell slot.
}}


#### The Cabin
:
Upon entering the cabin, we discovered an array of wondrous and mysterious objects on display:
:
* A shark tooth dagger, with teeth running down both sides, promised advantage against aquatic foes. 
* An enchanted snail shell functioned as a magical courier, allowing the holder to cast 'Sending' once per day. 
* An ancient piece of mariner's armor, weathered by the sea, bristled with barnacles but promised enhanced swimming speed and resistance against being knocked prone.
* A driftwood trident, interlaced with bits of coral, held the power to dominate aquatic creatures. 
* A magical net of snaring had the capability to trap enemies and could adjust its size to accommodate any creature up to large size. 
* The mantle of a manta ray, heavy and imposing, granted underwater breathing and increased swimming speed.
* A softly glowing pearl could replenish a spell slot up to third level once per day. 
* A glass orb, recognized as a drift globe, radiated a daylight spell with a 60-foot radius once per day. 
* A barnacled harp, crafted by the merfolk, could inspire allies with bardic inspiration once per day when played.
* A coral staff functioned as a spellcasting focus and allowed its bearer to control water once per day. 
* A luminous compass, [D3PUTY](#d3puty) identified the luminous compass as the handiwork of the Gyrewalkers - a nomadic group known for their advanced technology.
* Lastly, a bronze timepiece with the power to cast haste for one minute once every 24 hours piqued my interest, and I decided to claim it.

:
Amidst our fascination and mild bickering over the remaining items, we took our leave, each filling a small vial with mana from the cabin.

## Chapter 2 - Haling Cove
:
### Headed Home
*Play Date: July 25, 2023*
:
*Looking back, my time spent in Haling Cove floods my mind with vibrant recollections. The idyllic bay city, draped in a harmony of nature and civilization, always felt like a second home. The Sylvan Sentinels, my family, maintained a vigil over the encompassing forest, ensuring the city's tranquility. As a child, I would often lose myself in the labyrinth of marketplaces, drawn to the symphony of bustling life, the scent of spices, and the sight of numerous wares from far-off lands. I remember the wizards, Belvin and Roberto, their stories of magic and wonder resonating deep within me. Despite not being a part of the Sentinels myself, Haling Cove still shaped me, its influence running as deep as the roots of the forest that guards it.*
:
:
#### Centaurs
:
We resolved to enter Haling Cove under the cover of night, a decision accompanied by a shroud of uncertainty. Our journey began on a well-trodden path between [Willdale](#willdale) and [Haling Cove](#haling-cove), under the vast, twinkling canvas of the evening sky.
:
As we traveled, the rustling sounds of approach reached our ears. Drawing on my elven instincts, I melted into the shadows of the trees flanking our path. To our surprise, we were greeted by the sight of a pair of centaurs moving gracefully down the road. [Lucy](#lucy), ever the impulsive one, emerged in front of the majestic creatures, creating a momentary standstill.
:
[D3PUTY](#d3puty), in his typical observant manner, whispered to us that these centaurs, bathed in an ethereal bioluminescent glow, were likely members of the Shadowglow clan, and generally friendly. As Lucy attempted to explain our connection with [Sæsephyr](#Sæsephyr) the dragon, [Aleric](#aleric-mysticmind-stoneweaver) swiftly intervened, spinning a tale that Sæsephyr was merely a moniker, not an actual dragon. Astonishingly, the centaurs bought into the lie.
:
Providing us with invaluable information, they confirmed the route to Haling Cove should be unobstructed. However, they warned us to steer clear of the beaches, citing unusual creatures lurking along the coast. Their words, laced with caution, added an edge to my already wary spirits.
:
Deciding to err on the side of caution, we trailed the centaurs from a safe distance until the silhouette of Haling Cove began to take shape through the darkened trees.

* aleric looks around to see if anyone is watching. -- he feels as though he is being watched from two directions. uneasy feeling from the sea itself, as if there might be creatures watching from the water, or from the surface of the water. beyond that the rift makes him feel as if he were closer he might be seen from the rift itself. aleric speeks softly 'we are not the only ones here -- this could be bad'.
