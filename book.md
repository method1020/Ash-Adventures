# About Me
I am Asheris Starglade, a Wood Elf hailing from a secluded woodland community near Haling Cove, my families legacy is deeply intertwined with the Sylvan Sentinels, a revered group responsible for safeguarding the forest surrounding [Haling Cove](#haling-cove), the thriving city on the bay. However, despite my family's heritage, I have chosen a different path for myself.
:
Growing up in the woods, I developed a strong affinity for nature and a profound connection with the forest's creatures. As I reached adulthood, a sense of wanderlust and curiosity about the wider world drove me to embark on my own journey rather than following in the footsteps of my family. I sought to deepen my understanding of the diverse cultures and forge their own path as a Twilight Cleric, drawing upon the celestial gift they received in the hidden glade.
:
Despite not joining the ranks of the Sylvan Sentinels, I remain deeply committed to the protection of the forest and the harmony between the city and the natural world. I strive to use my divine powers to heal, guide, and bring balance wherever I go.

# Journal
:
{{watercolor4,top:20px,left:30px,width:300px,background-color:#BBAD82,opacity:30%}}

## Chapter 1 - Willdale and the Cloakwood
::

### Day 1 - Travels to Willdale
*Play Date: June 20, 2023*
::

#### On the Road
*My entires for today are not complete as this page of the journal got wet in my travels. - Ash*
:
We received a letter from a courier with a request for us to find [Talia](#talia) about a job. Gold these days has been getting short. So we figured the short walk was worth while. Travels to [Willdale](#willdale) are usually uneventful.
::

#### Town Center
**NEET TO FILL ALL THIS INFO IN...... FIND NOTES! luicy and i goign around, booming voice, the rest looking for tavern, etc. lucy robing tavern owner, us fleeing to the edge of town. Lucy taking pants. "Grabs the sack and gives him a wink"**

::::

### Day 2 - Meeting Talia
*Play Date: June 27, 2023*
::
#### Middle of the Night
*Play Date: June 27, 2023*
::
I was awoken in the middle of the night from my resting state. I heard a noise from the darkness ahead but couldn't quite place it. The rest of my adventurers appeared to be sleeping, having rushed from town the evening before. The ash's from the nights fire barely glowing. 
:
Suddenly a sticky web pinned me to a tree, I couldn't move at all. I looked out into the darkness, even with my keen eyesight, I was unable to see what is trapping me, or who attacked us. While [D3PUTY](#d3puty) looks out into the distance I wake up [Kuran](#kuran). Neither of them are able to see the monster either. We awaken the rest of the team.
:
I think in an attempt to bring light to the darkness, [Kuran](#kuran) lights a bolt of cloth on fire. Illuminating the area around us, but the foe remained cloaked in darkness. [Aleric](#aleric-mysticmind-stoneweaver) attempted to scare the monster with his *Hideous Laughter* but was unable to conjure the spell in his sleepy mental fog.
:
I am eventually able to break free from the sticky web after [Lucy](#lucy) ignites the tree I am trapped against on fire. But not before the team is struck with booming thunder from the skies ([Aleric](#aleric-mysticmind-stoneweaver) really needs to wake up!).
:
A giant armored spider finally makes it appearance by pouncing on [Aleric](#aleric-mysticmind-stoneweaver) -- pinning him to the ground! I attempted to attack the beast. Conjuring up my [Guiding Bolt](#guiding-bolt) but am unable to work it. (I really need to practice more).

:
With this failure, [D3PUTY](#d3puty) pulls his longbow (from where, I have no idea), and fires against the best. It collapses, defeated.

#### Meeting Talia
With the morning sun starting to rise I heard footsteps coming from the distance. An Elf and Dwarf approach. The Elf introduced herself as [Talia](#talia). Her and her dwarven comrades bring us to their camp in the north-east of [Willdale](#willdale).
:
The camp is made up of a handful of wooden cabins scattered about a small field -- [The Cloakwood](#the-cloakwood) surrounding it. I did notice a familiar tower near the edge of camp. Though I can't quite place it.
:
[D3PUTY](#d3puty) has discovered what [Talia](#talia) may want us for: he discovered that [Talia](#talia) has been doing some extensive research into the Fey of the [Cloakwood](#the-cloakwood).
:
We met [Talia](#talia) outside. She informed us we have been hired to determine why the [Brownies](#brownies) have been attacking the towns folk and loggers.
:
[D3PUTY](#d3puty) pulled from his knowledge-base that this is very unusual behavior for [Brownies](#brownies), they are typically "insited", simple minded, and there are for scarier things in [The Cloakwood](#the-cloakwood) than dwarves.
: 
[Talia](#talia) has provided us direction, and we set out.

#### Discovering the Cloakwood

### Day 2 - Continuation of the Cloakwood
::
#### The Tent
:
{{note
##### Account of Aleric, D3PUTY, and Kuran
:
The group had found themselves in a serene setting—a small pond adjacent to a towering boulder. Kuran had taken the initiative to explore the area in search of signs of the elusive Brownies, while Aleric and D3PUTY observed with anticipation. The tranquil atmosphere and the air of mystery that surrounded the scene piqued his curiosity.
}}
:
As I stealthily made my way through the eastern forest, I skillfully maneuvered around the worn and disheveled camp in the distance. My goal was clear: reach the trail that led northward to meet up with [Aleric](#aleric-mysticmind-stoneweaver), [Kuran](#kuran), and [D3PUTY](#d3puty). I knew the importance of maintaining a safe distance from the tent, so I focused on staying hidden as I moved through the undergrowth.
:
Every step I took was deliberate, ensuring I made no unnecessary noise that could give away my presence. The forest seemed to offer its guidance, revealing hidden paths that led me closer to my companions. I remained vigilant, scanning my surroundings for any signs of danger or potential obstacles.
:
Navigating through the dense foliage, I followed the concealed trail with determination. I carefully evaded any traces of detection, my instincts guiding me towards the rendezvous point. Finally, I emerged from the forest, relieved to see the familiar faces of [Aleric](#aleric-mysticmind-stoneweaver), [Kuran](#kuran), and [D3PUTY](#d3puty) waiting for me.
:
With a sense of accomplishment, I explained my decision to bypass the worn and disheveled camp, focusing instead on our shared journey and the mysteries that awaited us. 
:
#### Fudh and Goim
:
We headed south towards the tent and [Kuran](#kuran) and I skillfully approached the worn and disheveled tent, our curiosity pushed us to investigate further. [Kuran](#kuran) quietly peeked inside, revealing a surprising scene of Brownies engrossed in sticks and dice games. Among them, two stood out—one with a brown hat and the other with a distinctive red hat.
:
To our astonishment, the Brownie with the red hat noticed Kuran's presence and eagerly divulged details about their camp. He mentioned that their leader, known as [Grum](#grum), was waiting for us. Intrigued, [Aleric](#aleric-mysticmind-stoneweaver) joined our conversation, observing that the Brownie with the red hat seemed a little peculiar, smirking and hinting at the mysterious nature of meeting Grum.
:
{{pageNumber,auto}}
{{footnote Chapter 1 | Willdale and The Cloakwood}}
\page

They introduce themselves as [Fud](#fud) and [Goim](#goim).
:
However, it was [the Brownie](#the-brownies) wearing the brown hat who seized the opportunity. He cunningly offered to exchange our gold for a chance to meet Grum and be guided to their camp. With a slight hesitation, we relinquished the gold, intrigued by the prospect of discovering more about these enigmatic Brownies and their elusive leader.
:
#### To the Camp
:
As [Aleric](#aleric-mysticmind-stoneweaver) and [Kuran](#kuran) trailed the Brownies towards their camp, [D3PUTY](#d3puty) quietly followed Kuran's lead, while I stealthily sneaked alongside, remaining unnoticed by the rest of the party. Little did we know that [Grum](#grum), the leader of the Brownies, would turn out to be an unusually large and fat Boggle, a rare sight given their usual small stature.
:
Seizing the opportunity, I crept up behind [Grum](#grum) and the Brownies in their camp, equipped with sleeping mushroom spores harvested from the mushrooms growing on my shoulders. With a swift application, I put three of the Brownies to sleep, leaving the remaining ones trembling in fear as they fled. The group, sensing an advantage, launched an attack on Grum.
:
I took the initiative and employed a necrotic mushroom, inflicting severe damage akin to an acid burn onto Grum's shoulder. Our combined efforts proved successful as we fought valiantly, taking on the formidable Boggle. The encounter was intense and full of surprises, as our party faced a foe larger and more dangerous than expected.
::
![boggle-grum](https://github.com/method1020/Ash-Adventures/blob/main/images/people/boggle_grum.jpg?raw=true) {width:100%,mix-blend-mode:multiply}
:
In the midst of the chaotic battle, [Aleric's](#aleric-mysticmind-stoneweaver) attempt to cast hideous laughter on [Grum](#grum) backfires, leaving him laughing uncontrollably. [Kuran's](#kuran) attack misses its mark, and [Grum](#grum), displaying an unexpected ability, becomes shiny and oily, reappearing on the other side of the field. [D3PUTY's](#d3puty) attempt with the longbow also fails, as does my own with the crossbow.
:
Determined to subdue [Grum](#grum), [Kuran](#kuran) fiercely strikes him while he tries to escape. [Grum](#grum), displaying his teleportation ability, surprises us by suddenly appearing behind me. [Aleric](#aleric-mysticmind-stoneweaver), moving with surprising swiftness, pommels Grum with a dagger, rendering him unconscious.
:
As I survey the remaining Brownies, [Kuran](#kuran) shouts, "Are you not amused?" After [Kuran's](#kuran) taunting words echo through the clearing, the remaining Brownies are visibly frightened. The unexpected display of power from our group and the defeat of their leader, Grum, have left them no choice but to scatter in all directions. Their tiny figures disappear into the foliage, escaping into the safety of the forest.
:
As the dust settles, the once lively camp now lies in silence, only the rustling of leaves and the occasional hoot of an owl filling the air. We gather ourselves, ensuring that [Grum](#grum) is securely fastened to [D3PUTY's](#d3puty) back. Despite the intensity of the battle, a sense of relief washes over us. We've achieved our goal, but our journey is far from over.
:
With a collective understanding, we decide to make our way back, carrying Grum with us. The forest slowly envelopes us once more as we walk through the undergrowth, retracing our steps to return to the place where it all began.
:
Our minds buzz with thoughts of the encounters we've had and the mysteries that still linger. Together, we forge ahead, our bond growing stronger with every step we take. A new adventure awaits us, and we are ready to face whatever the forest has in store, united as a resilient and formidable group.
:
#### Returning to Willdale
:
As I quietly rest inside Grum's dingy tent, I observe through my sleepless trance the lively interactions around me. Lucy's arrival sparks laughter and amusement as she shares her latest escapade, trying to hawk the stolen pants from her time in Willdale. Her mischievous spirit never fails to bring a smile to our faces (well, most of our fa ces).
:
Deciding to spend the night in Grum's thatch hut, D3PUTY and Lucy stand outside, engaged in a conversation that seems both deep and lighthearted. I hear snippets of real-life questions that they discuss.
:
{{pageNumber,auto}}
{{footnote Chapter 1 | Willdale and The Cloakwood}}
\page

From my vantage point, I watch as D3PUTY studies Grum closely, sensing a dark and ominous magic surrounding him—a magic that reminds us of the Faye wilds or the Shadow Fells. Grum's presence seems to carry an aura of uncertainty and intrigue, and I can't help but wonder about the secrets he holds.
:
Lucy, with her astute intuition, attempts to figure out what deity Grum worships, her knowledge of the arcane guiding her investigation. She seems to deduce that Grum was pulled from another plane, adding yet another layer of mystery to this enigmatic Boggle.
:
As the night deepens, I continue to listen to the conversations and watch the events unfold around me. The campfire crackles, casting shadows on the faces of my companions. While I rest, my mind remains alert, taking in the stories, the discoveries, and the enigmas that make our journey ever more fascinating.
