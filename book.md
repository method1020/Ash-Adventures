# About Me
I am Asheris Starglade, a Wood Elf hailing from a secluded woodland community near Haling Cove, my families legacy is deeply intertwined with the Sylvan Sentinels, a revered group responsible for safeguarding the forest surrounding [Haling Cove](#haling-cove), the thriving city on the bay. However, despite my family's heritage, I have chosen a different path for myself.
:
Growing up in the woods, I developed a strong affinity for nature and a profound connection with the forest's creatures. As I reached adulthood, a sense of wanderlust and curiosity about the wider world drove me to embark on my own journey rather than following in the footsteps of my family. I sought to deepen my understanding of the diverse cultures and forge their own path as a Twilight Cleric, drawing upon the celestial gift they received in the hidden glade.
:
Despite not joining the ranks of the Sylvan Sentinels, I remain deeply committed to the protection of the forest and the harmony between the city and the natural world. I strive to use my divine powers to heal, guide, and bring balance wherever I go.

# Journal
:
{{watercolor4,top:20px,left:30px,width:300px,background-color:#BBAD82,opacity:30%}}

## Chapter 1
::

### Day 1 - Travels to Willdale
*Play Date: June 20, 2023*
::

#### On the Road
*My entires for today are not complete as this page of the journal got wet in my travels. - Ash*
:
We received a letter from a courier with a request for us to find [Talia](#talia) about a job. Gold these days has been getting short. So we figured the short walk was worth while. Travels to [Willdale](#willdale) are usually uneventful.
::

#### Town Center
**NEET TO FILL ALL THIS INFO IN...... FIND NOTES! luicy and i goign around, booming voice, the rest looking for tavern, etc. lucy robing tavern owner, us fleeing to the edge of town. Lucy taking pants. "Grabs the sack and gives him a wink"**

::::

### Day 2 - Meeting Talia
*Play Date: June 27, 2023*
::
#### Middle of the Night
*Play Date: June 27, 2023*
::
I was awoken in the middle of the night from my resting state. I heard a noise from the darkness ahead but couldn't quite place it. The rest of my adventurers appeared to be sleeping, having rushed from town the evening before. The ash's from the nights fire barely glowing. 
:
Suddenly a sticky web pinned me to a tree, I couldn't move at all. I looked out into the darkness, even with my keen eyesight, I was unable to see what is trapping me, or who attacked us. While [D3PUTY](#d3puty) looks out into the distance I wake up [Kuran](#kuran). Neither of them are able to see the monster either. We awaken the rest of the team.
:
I think in an attempt to bring light to the darkness, [Kuran](#kuran) lights a bolt of cloth on fire. Illuminating the area around us, but the foe remained cloaked in darkness. [Aleric](#aleric-mysticmind-stoneweaver) attempted to scare the monster with his *Hideous Laughter* but was unable to conjure the spell in his sleepy mental fog.
:
I am eventually able to break free from the sticky web after [Lucy](#lucy) ignites the tree I am trapped against on fire. But not before the team is struck with booming thunder from the skies ([Aleric](#aleric-mysticmind-stoneweaver) really needs to wake up!).
:
A giant armored spider finally makes it appearance by pouncing on [Aleric](#aleric-mysticmind-stoneweaver) -- pinning him to the ground! I attempted to attack the beast. Conjuring up my [Guiding Bolt](#guiding-bolt) but am unable to work it. (I really need to practice more).

:
With this failure, [D3PUTY](#d3puty) pulls his longbow (from where, I have no idea), and fires against the best. It collapses, defeated.

#### Meeting Talia
With the morning sun starting to rise I heard footsteps coming from the distance. An Elf and Dwarf approach. The Elf introduced herself as [Talia](#talia). Her and her dwarven comrades bring us to their camp in the north-east of [Willdale](#willdale).
:
The camp is made up of a handful of wooden cabins scattered about a small field -- [The Cloakwood](#the-cloakwood) surrounding it. I did notice a familiar tower near the edge of camp. Though I can't quite place it.
:
[D3PUTY](#d3puty) has discovered what [Talia](#talia) may want us for: he discovered that [Talia](#talia) has been doing some extensive research into the Fey of the [Cloakwood](#the-cloakwood).
:
We met [Talia](#talia) outside. She informed us we have been hired to determine why the [Brownies](#brownies) have been attacking the towns folk and loggers.
:
[D3PUTY](#d3puty) pulled from his knowledge-base that this is very unusual behavior for [Brownies](#brownies), they are typically "insited", simple minded, and there are for scarier things in [The Cloakwood](#the-cloakwood) than dwarves.
: 
[Talia](#talia) has provided us direction, and we set out.
::
#### Discovering the Cloakwood

**glade to the north-east where they are attacking from.
talia gives directions.**

**following a trail. -- used by smaller brownies 4ft tall.
some regularity
following the gaps in the trees.**
**ash recalls generally the brownies
	setup little camps all over the place
	no common leadership, live and keep to themselves
	prefer finding interesting location and  good sources of food.
	tend to leave humanoids alone.**
**stories of the sentinels getting forced out of towers.**

**brownies speak sylvan, sometimes halfling, sometimes common.

karan climbs a tree, very big tree, but doesn't really see anything.**


**ash and kuran went south, the rest went to the easet.
the path looks well worn and quiet.
heat a lot of wildlife.**

**the group to the north comes out to an opening in the forest.****
